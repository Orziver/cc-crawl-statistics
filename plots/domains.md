Top-500 Registered Domains of the Latest Main Crawl
===================================================

The table below shows the top 500 registered domains (in terms of page captures) of the last main/monthly crawl
({{ site.latest_crawl }}). The underlying data is also provided in CSV format, see [domains-top-500.csv](./domains-top-500.csv).

Note that the ranking by page captures only partially corresponds to the importance of domains, as the
crawler respects the robots.txt and tries hard not to overload web servers. Highly ranked domains tend to be
underrepresented. If you're looking for a list of domain or host names ranked by page rank or harmonic centrality,
consider using one of the [webgraph datasets](https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-webgraph#exploring-webgraph-data-sets)
instead.
